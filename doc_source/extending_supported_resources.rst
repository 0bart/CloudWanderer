=========================

One of the primary objectives of CloudWanderer is to make it extremely easy to extend the supported resources.
Boto3's JSON definitions for :ref:`boto3:guide_resources` makes this possible. In this section of the documentation we will explain
what these definitions look like and how to create your own.
