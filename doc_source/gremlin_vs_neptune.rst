Gremlin Vs Neptune
====================

- Gremlin 
    is an extremely comprehensive and powerful Graph Database Query Language with a Server that can be run locally with ease.
- Neptune
    is AWS's hosted Graph Database, which supports multiple query languages including Gremlin and OpenCypher

Overall OpenCypher is easier to get started with as it has a SQL-like syntax, if you have access to an AWS account it's strongly recommended
that you follow the :doc:`neptune_quickstart` to get started very cheaply with auto-stopping databases and instances.

If you want to start off locally you can follow the instructions in the :doc:`index` readme to run a local Gremlin server and get started for free!
